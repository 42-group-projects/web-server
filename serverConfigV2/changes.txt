relative path are working
servername is a vector 
dont forget the ;
all must be in server block 
cgi becomes cgi_handler in conf files
per location error pages are a thing now error page must be found in location and if not in server config
per location client max body size are a thing now error page must be found in location and if not in server config

updload_path is now upload_store
locations dont have to have a root anymore and can use the default one 
ther is no upload_enabled bool anymore. upload is enabled if the upload_store string isnt empty
no need to put an ip adress in the listen directive. it can default to 0.0.0.0
